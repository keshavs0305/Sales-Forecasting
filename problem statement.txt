The main columns are:
- Customer name
- Order nº
- Item name
- Quantity

Each order nº is one order for the corresponding customer. Each order have different items in different quantities.

I need a model to predict for each customer:
- when they will put a order
- which items will be on the order
- how many quantities of each item will be on the order
